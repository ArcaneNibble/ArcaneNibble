# Hi!

This is @ArcaneNibble, aka R! I'm a "hacker," "technologist," "catgirl," and many other descriptors. Here's a sampling of projects:

# Electronics

## ["remex"](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/remex-wch)

This is a CH32V307 RISC-V MCU dev board with gigabit Ethernet

## [PY32 fidget spinner](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/puya-spinner)

This is a deliberately-overengineered fidget spinner built around a Chinese ARM MCU, showing off just how cheap technology has become

## [LCSC parts tester](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/china-lcsc-undoc-parts-test)

Filling in some poorly-documented corners of the datasheets for some interesting parts found on LCSC

## [Hexpansion headphone jack](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/hexpansion-headphones)

Headphone codec for the EMFCamp Tildagon badge

## [Hexpansion infrared](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/hexpansion-ir-tool)

38 kHz IR TX/RX for the EMFCamp Tildagon badge

## [JLCPCB capabilities test cat ears](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/jlc-katzen)

I wanted to quickly test JLCPCB's turn-key assembly process with a 4-layer board with an unusual shape.

## Electronics bygones

### [Yahoo! Paranoids DEFCON badge](https://github.com/theparanoids/keyhole-badge/)

Conference badge with BLE, microphone, and blinkies

### [Yahoo! Paranoids Hackme](https://github.com/theparanoids/hardware-hackme-1-eda)

Platform for running hardware hackmes and teaching colleagues about embedded systems

### [SLG46582 test board](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/gp-ldo-test-board)

Cheap I2C-programmable LDOs with additional capabilities. Uncertain future after the string of M&As ending in Renesas

### [CuteRunner](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/cuterunner)

Cheap Xilinx/AMD CoolRunner-II dev board, killed due to chip shortage and parts becoming EOL

### [Project Chibi board](https://github.com/ArcaneNibble/project-chibi-dev-board)

Altera/Intel MAX V dev board. Large mega-board turned out to not be a good design. Shelved due to chip shortage.
